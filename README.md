What this is

A client-side LocalScript for Roblox Studio / your own game that simulates extreme client lag for testing or comedic effect.
It creates many client-only GUI elements and (optionally) runs CPU-heavy math on the client to make that player's game lag severely. It does not create server-side parts or affect other players when used as intended.

Important safety & policy notes

Do NOT use this script in public or live games. Running it in a published, public, or multiplayer environment may disrupt other players, violate Roblox community rules, and lead to complaints or moderation action.

Use only in your own private test places or with explicit consent from everyone on the server. Never deploy to production.

This script is client-side only. Do not attempt to convert it into exploiter scripts (Delta, Arceus X, etc.) or otherwise run it through third-party executors. Using or distributing exploit code is against Roblox’s Terms of Service.

Extreme caution: spawning very large numbers of UI objects or forcing intense CPU work can crash the client or Studio. Start with small values and increase slowly.

You are responsible for how and where you use it. Follow Roblox Terms of Service and community guidelines.
